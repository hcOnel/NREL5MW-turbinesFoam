Pre-processing scripts:
	bladeGeomConverter.m
		takes bladeGeom.txt and bladeProfiles.txt.
			bladeGeom.txt: geometric data at the airfoil sections along blade, in form of qblade output:
			Radial Position [m]          Chord Length [m]               Twist [deg]     Pitch Axis Offset [m]  Thread Axis in [% chord]              Airfoil Name            360 Polar Name
			bladeProfiles.txt: airfoil names at given sections, line by line
		generates fvOptionsBladeGeomInput.dat.
			ready to copy-paste into fvOptions file for turbinesFoam. qblade data includes beginning-end section info, this scripts converts this into element-center data by interpolation.
	multiRePolarConverter.m
		script to convert batch-analyzed qblade multi-reynolds cl cd data into turbinesFoam usable profile files.
		takes qBladePolarOutput/*
			this directory includes cl cd data of airfoils for various reynolds numbers. qblade output format should be aerodyn (nrel).
		generates convertedClCdData/*
			these files are compatible with turbinesFoam multiRe entry method.

Post-processing scripts:
	postProc.m
		takes postProcessing directory obtained by turbinesFoam (copy-paste into this directory), rotorBEMsimulation_noTipLoss directory (results of qblade).
		generates results along blade span and compares.
