A test case to validate turbinesFoam library by simulating the NREL-5MW turbine. Cases are intended to be identical to SOWFA. Turbine data obtained from SOWFA.

turbinesFoam: https://github.com/turbinesFoam/turbinesFoam
SOWFA's NREL-5MW case: https://github.com/NREL/SOWFA/tree/master/exampleCases/example.ALM

Rotor radius = 63m

case_isolated:
	An isolated rotor, free from boundary effects.
	No ABL, no wall functions, slip BC at farfield.
	Fixed inlet velocity.
	No tower, no hub, no nacelle introduced.
	* Rotation is CCW due to endEffects bug -> to be fixed
	U_inf = 11.4 m/s, TSR = 7
	Domain extends: (D is rotor diameter)
		x: -10D to 30D
		y: -10D to 10D
		z: -10D to 10D
	Farfield cell size = 84m
	Rotor region cell size = 2.625m
	dt = 0.02s
	nCells per rotor radius = 24
	Rotor revolution per timeStep = 1.451deg
	Blade tip travels per cell size per time step = 0.614
